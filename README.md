# Mapping-Earthquakes

## Purpose of Project
We have been tasked with creating a server that maps Earthquakes from the past 7 days from across the globe. In order to do this, we will create a custom map that was provided to us by Mapbox. We also get our earthquake data from the website https://earthquake.usgs.gov/

## Multiple Map Options
With our custom map, we have created three possible styles as our base layer option. The first one is the Streets view: <br>

The Second one is a satellite view: <br>

And our final one is a dark view: <br>

## Multiple Overlay Objects
From there, we will create three unique overlay options. The first of which will be showing the tectonic plate borders of the world,<br>

The second one shows a marker for each earthquake that was recorded from the past seven days. We went with a circle marker for these, with the radius of said marker being determined by the magnitude of the earthquake. To make it easier for the viewer, we also created a legend, with different colors signifying different magnitudes. When you click on a marker for an earthquake, it will give you both the magnitude data and the location for that specific earthquake. <br>

Finally, we created a layer that shpws only major earthquakes, those with magnitudes of 4.5 and above. We included the same markers as the above layer for this. <br>
